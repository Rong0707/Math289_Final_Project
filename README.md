# Math289_Final_Project

This is the final project for Math289C. Here we build a classification model using xgboost in R.

##Data

Training and test datasets were downloaded from Kaggle: [BNP Paribas Cardif Claims Management](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bnp-paribas-cardif-claims-management)

## R Scripts

- xgboost_ohe_ensemble.R 
   -  ensembled xgboost model using one-hot-encoding
- xgboost_ohe_validation.R
   -  validation of ensembled xgboost model using one-hot-encoding
- Parameter_tuning
   - tune parameters for xgboost model 

## Report

Source code for final report is in Final.Rmd and complied pdf file is Final.pdf.
